## üìå What is This Repository For?

This repository serves as a community-driven collection of host OS configuration modules, which can be used to fine-tune the underlying host operating system for MOSK deployments. Contributors from the community, Mirantis professional services, and customer support teams can publish their modules here.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To use any of the modules from this repository:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
2. Browse the available modules in the respective directories.
3. Follow the provided documentation or instructions within each module's folder to build it.

5. Following the instructions provided in [MOSK Operations Guide :: Bare metal operations :: Host OS configuration](https://docs.mirantis.com/mosk/latest/ops/bm-operations/host-os-conf.html) for adding a custom module.
